## my #100DaysOfCode â€¢ 2019

After successfully learning the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript in 2017 & 2018, I will start a new round of #100DaysOfCode in 2019 â€“ hopefully 3. ðŸ™‚

In mid-January I will start a new position as Junior Frontend Dev in Munich, Germany. Therefore the focus will be on the tech stack used in the company, but also on different topics that interest me personally.

main focus:
* JavaScript, especially ES6+ features
* Vue.js as frontend framework
* Node.js
* testing JavaScript
* basics of Ruby & Ruby on Rails

side focus:
* advanced CSS
* different CSS frameworks
* CSS transitions & animations
* CSS-in-JS
* generative art with p5.js
* Mathematics for computer science

projects:
* new portfolio/website
* start a mini blog
* start a series of mini creative coding exercises
* participate in the codepen challange as often as possible
